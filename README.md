# Unconference
Mission: *the most efficient way **ever** to organize a conference*
* * *
**Problem:** organizing conferences is not as easy as it could be

The general idea is to use the Hong Kong unconference as a test case to discover problems (and solutions) in the critical path to a fun unconference.

* * *
**Problem:** don't know how much interest there is for an unconference in Hong Kong

**Solution:** ask people to pay a relatively small amount to join an ordered list for ticket distribution.

This list will be the order that tickets will be distributed in. If fully funded by Jack, the tickets will be free. If not, this list will be a right of first refusal chain.

**Problem:** don't know when people are able to attend   
**Solution:** when people join the ticketing waitlist, they can select date ranges within the next 12 months. There are three types of date ranges: 
* **possible** are date ranges when the person can possibly attend. This is the starting condition for the entire 12 months in the UX.
* **cannot** are date ranges where the person knows they definitely cannot attend.
* **optimal** are date ranges where the person would prefer to attend.

All npubs in the ticketing waitlist can modify their date ranges as often as they like (replaceable events).

**Problem:** conferences cost money   
**Possible Solutions:** 

1. The Hong Kong government just sponsored a huge web3 conference, I can probably get them to sponsor a nostr unconference. Currently poking around to ask about this.

2. We will know ahead of time the total capacity of the conference and also the total cost, so we know the cost for hosting each attendee. We could ask people by default to cover this cost for themselves, and also add an option to request a free ticket if they can't afford this. Other people will probably be happy to pay for 2 tickets which would cover the free ones. Maybe we could indicate on the badge if someone sponsored a free ticket.
